# EPA Forms
This module's purpose is to manage all customizations regarding how EPA content authors access and interact with the "Form" content type provided by the "Webform Node" contributed module.

Most of Webform's standard permissions are left unchecked at the Drupal role level. This module's function is to allow EPA's content authors access to managing Webforms (and their submissions), but only those Webforms where the "Form" node resides within Web Area they are a member of. We utilize Group level permissions for access to the "Form" node and through custom group permissions included in this module, to grant access to those Webform Submissions.

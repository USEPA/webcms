            "value": "The Safe Drinking Water Act provides states or EPA the authority to grant variances and exemptions to help public water systems achieve compliance with maximum contaminant levels (MCLs).\r\n\r\nVariances allow eligible systems to provide drinking water that does not comply with a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) on the condition that the system installs a certain technology and the quality of the drinking water is still protective of public health.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of variances:\r\n\r\n    General variances are intended for systems that are not able to comply with a NPDWR due to their source water quality and there is no feasible alternate source of water.\r\n    Small system variances are for systems serving 3,300 persons or fewer that cannot afford to comply with a NPDWR (but they may be allowed on a case-by-case basis for systems serving up to 10,000 persons). Small system variances are not allowed for microbial contaminants.\r\n\r\nExemptions allow eligible systems additional time to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance with new NPDWRs, while continuing to provide acceptable levels of public health protection. Exemptions do not allow a water system to violate NPDWRs. Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution (i.e., treatment or a new source).\r\nVariance and Exemption Rule Exceptions:\r\n\r\n    Systems that have received a small system variance are not eligible for an exemption.\r\n    Small System Variances may not be granted for NPDWRs that do not list a small system variance technology (SSTV).\r\n    Systems that have received an exemption are generally not eligible for a variance.\r\n    General Variances may generally not be granted for the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total coliforms or any of the treatment technique (TT) requirements of Subpart H of 40 CFR 141.\r\n    Small system variances may not be granted for NPDWRs promulgated prior to1986 or MCLs, indicators, and TTs for microbial contaminants.\r\n    Exemptions from the MCL for total coliforms under Total Coliform Rule and E.coli under the Revised Total Coliform Rule, may generally not be granted.\r\n\r\nVariances and Exemptions are not allowed under the Revised Total Coliform Rule.\r\n\r\nVariances and Exemptions for Small Drinking Water Systems.\r\n\r\nThe 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments revised the existing variances and exemptions regulations [63 FR 157, August 14, 1998]. The revisions incorporate the parts of the SDWA Amendments dealing with\r\n\r\n    Implementing \"general\" variances for public drinking water systems;\r\n    Implementing new small system variances for water suppliers that serve fewer than 10,000 people; and\r\n    Implementing changes related to exemptions.\r\n\r\nThe revised regulations created a new affordability-based small systems variance. The small system variance may be granted to a public water system serving 3,300 or fewer persons. With the approval of EPA's Administrator, a system serving 3,301-10,000 persons may also be granted a small system variance.\r\n\r\nThe rule highlights the conditions for granting small system variances under SDWA section 1415(e)(3). This section states that certain affordability criteria must be met in order to qualify for a variance. The affordability criteria set by the state must include assessments that:\r\n\r\n    The small public water system is unable to afford to comply with a NPDWR through treatment;\r\n    The small public water system is unable to afford to comply by developing an alternative source of water; and\r\n    The small public water system cannot implement necessary restructuring changes or consolidation with another system. (The State can make a written determination that restructuring or consolidation is not practical in that situation).\r\n\r\nIf all these conditions are met, the State may grant a small systems variance. The variance states that the system must install, operate, and maintain a nationally listed variance technology. The terms of the variance are set by the State to ensure \"adequate protection of human health.\"\r\nQuick Reference Guide:\r\n\r\nVariances and Exemptions: A Quick Reference Guide (PDF)(4 pp, 112 K About PDF) The quick reference guide provides a summary of the Variances and Exemptions Rule.",

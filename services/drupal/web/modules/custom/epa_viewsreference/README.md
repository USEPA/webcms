# EPA Viewsreference
This module aims to provide additional functionality to content authors that are using the 'Dynamic List' paragraph type. This paragraph type makes use of the Views Reference field type provided by the [Views Reference Field](https://www.drupal.org/project/viewsreference) module and the supplemental [Views Reference Field Filter](https://www.drupal.org/project/viewsreference_filterhttps://www.drupal.org/project/viewsreference_filter) module to give content authors the ability to customize their dynamic lists as they see fit.

This module adds a couple additional controls to enable content authors to:
1. Enable toggling the display of a pager in the Dynamic List
2. Enable displaying and configuring a custom "No results found" message.
3. Allow content authors to choose which view mode to display the content in.

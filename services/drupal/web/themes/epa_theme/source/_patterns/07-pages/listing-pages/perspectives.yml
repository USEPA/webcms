    heading: 'Celebrating a Win-Win: 30 Years of Progress Under the Pollution Prevention Act'
    description: 'On this day in 1990, a new era was ushered in for EPA and the nation when the Pollution Prevention (P2) Act was signed into law.  The act gave the agency new tools to join with states, tribes, and communities to prevent pollution before it happens.  It also marked a shift in the paradigm of environmental protection which had been mostly focused on end-of-pipe pollution control and clean-up strategies.'

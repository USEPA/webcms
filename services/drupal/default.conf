    # When an AWS ALB performs a health check against the Drupal ECS task, it uses the
    # container's IP address for the Host header. If this health check is performed after

    # a cached page that refers to that private IP (e.g., 10.x.y.z) instead of the site
    # domain, rendering assets unusable.

    # reject the load balancer health check. A failed health check would cause it to be
    # restarted by AWS, putting every container in an infinite loop.
    # As a result, we instead force the value of HTTP_HOST to be the site's domain in all

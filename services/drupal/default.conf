    # When an AWS ALB performs a health check against the Drupal ECS task, it uses the
    # container's IP address for the Host header. If this health check is performed after
    # a cache clear, then it's possible that Drupal will create aggregated CSS/JS or even
    # a cached page that refers to that private IP (e.g., 10.x.y.z) instead of the site
    # domain, rendering assets unusable.
    # Normally, we would use trusted host headers here, but that would cause Drupal to
    # reject the load balancer health check. A failed health check would cause it to be
    # restarted by AWS, putting every container in an infinite loop.
    # As a result, we instead force the value of HTTP_HOST to be the site's domain in all

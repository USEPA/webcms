## üìÇ Archived Scripts

### 1. `allow-unprocessed.sh`
**Purpose:** Configure acceptable thresholds for unprocessed migration items.

**Function:**
- Sets Drupal state variables for migration tolerance
- Allows migration to proceed with known unprocessed items
- Targets specific content types that had migration issues

**Usage (Historical):**
```bash
# Required: drushvpc-stage.json in current directory
# Required: AWS_PROFILE configured for stage environment
bash scripts/archive/d7-migration/allow-unprocessed.sh
```

**State Variables Set:**
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_document`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_event`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_faq`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_news_release`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_page`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_public_notice`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_regulation`
- `epa.allowed_unprocessed.upgrade_d7_node_revision_webform`
- Plus additional panelizer and paragraph variants

### 2. `start-stage-migration.sh`
**Purpose:** Initiate the D7‚ÜíD8 migration process on the stage environment.

**Function:**
- Launches ECS task with `drush-migrate` command
- Allocates 8GB memory for migration process
- Runs on Fargate in the stage cluster

**Usage (Historical):**
```bash
# Required: drushvpc-stage.json in current directory
# Required: AWS_PROFILE configured for stage environment
bash scripts/archive/d7-migration/start-stage-migration.sh
```

**Notes:**
- Migration script location: `/services/drupal/scripts/ecs/drush-migrate.sh`
- Can be stopped using `halt-stage-migration.sh`

### 3. `halt-stage-migration.sh`
**Purpose:** Gracefully stop a running migration process.

**Function:**
- Sets `epa.migrations_halted` state variable to `true`
- Stops all active migrations (`drush mst --all`)
- Prevents migration from continuing to next content type

**Usage (Historical):**
```bash
# Required: drushvpc-stage.json in current directory
# Required: AWS_PROFILE configured for stage environment
bash scripts/archive/d7-migration/halt-stage-migration.sh
```

## üö´ Why These Scripts Should Not Be Used

1. **Migration Complete:** The D7‚ÜíD8 migration finished in 2020
2. **Wrong Target:** Scripts target D8, but the system is now D10
3. **Obsolete State:** Migration state variables are no longer relevant
4. **Database Schema:** Current database reflects D10 schema, not D7 or D8
5. **Breaking Changes:** Running these could corrupt the production D10 database

## üìö References for Future Migrations

If you need to perform future migrations (e.g., D10‚ÜíD11), consider this migration approach as a reference:

### Migration Pattern
1. **Pre-Migration:** Set acceptable thresholds for known issues
2. **Execution:** Run migration in isolated environment (stage)
3. **Monitoring:** Track progress via ECS console and CloudWatch logs
4. **Control:** Ability to halt migration gracefully if issues arise

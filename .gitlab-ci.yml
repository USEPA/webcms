# WebCMS GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
# Orchestrates complete deployment pipeline for EPA WebCMS Drupal application.
# Handles infrastructure provisioning, Docker builds, security scanning, and deployments.
# See docs/cicd-pipeline.md for detailed documentation.
#
# Pipeline Variables:
# - WEBCMS_SITE_FILTER: Set to 'stage' or 'dev' to filter which site's jobs run in the pipeline
#   Example: WEBCMS_SITE_FILTER=stage will only build and deploy stage site
#   Leave unset to build and deploy both sites

stages:
  # Docker Image Builds (all branches) - Build first to enable testing
  - Build                             # Build application Docker images (drupal, nginx, drush)

  # Security Scanning (run before deployments for early feedback)
  # TEMPORARY: Disabled for testing - RE-ENABLE THESE STAGES BEFORE MERGING TO PRODUCTION
  # - Test                              # Run SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection
  # - Scan                              # Prisma Cloud image vulnerability scanning

  # Infrastructure Provisioning (live branch only)
  - Infrastructure:Preprod:Init       # Initialize Terraform backend and providers
  - Infrastructure:Preprod:Validate   # Validate Terraform configuration syntax
  - Infrastructure:Preprod:Plan       # Generate Terraform execution plan
  - Infrastructure:Preprod:Apply      # Apply infrastructure changes (manual approval required)

  # Production Deployment (live branch → WEBCMS_SITE: dev)
  - Deploy:Dev:Init                   # Initialize production deployment (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Dev:Validate               # Validate production Terraform config (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Dev:Plan                   # Plan production deployment (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Dev:Apply                  # Apply production deployment (English + Spanish parallel)

  # Staging Deployment (staging branch → WEBCMS_SITE: stage)
  - Deploy:Stage:Init                 # Initialize staging deployment (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Stage:Validate             # Validate staging Terraform config (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Stage:Plan                 # Plan staging deployment (English + Spanish parallel)
  - Deploy:Stage:Apply                # Apply staging deployment (English + Spanish parallel)

  # Database Updates (Drush operations via ECS tasks)
  - Update                            # Run Drush updates for all sites (parallel by site/language)

  # Release Management (create artifacts after successful deployment)
  - Artifacts                         # Create deployment artifacts
  - Release                           # Create GitLab releases

# Global Pipeline Configuration
# Our GitLab runner environment is Docker-based, so we apply this tag to every step.
default:
  tags:
    - docker

  # Global caching strategy (fallback/shared cache across all jobs):
  # More specific caches are defined in templates and override this:
  # - Terraform: Lines 116-123 (cached by module + .terraform.lock.hcl for provider binaries)
  # - Composer:  Lines 335-340 (cached by branch for PHP dependencies in Drupal builds)
  # - npm:       Lines 270-278 (cached by ci/package-lock.json for Drush automation)
  cache:
    key: global-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    paths:
      - .gitlab-ci-cache/  # General-purpose cache directory for miscellaneous artifacts

# Define this variable once here and allow it to cascade down into jobs and child
# pipelines. Creates unique image tags based on branch and commit for reproducible builds.
variables:
  WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG: $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG-$CI_COMMIT_SHA

# Include GitLab's built-in security scanning templates for comprehensive security testing
# and Teams notifications for pipeline events
# TEMPORARY: Security scanning templates disabled - RE-ENABLE BEFORE MERGING TO PRODUCTION

  # - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml     # Detect exposed secrets in code
  - local: .gitlab/teams-notifications.yml            # Teams webhook notifications

#region Templates
# Reusable job templates that provide common configuration for pipeline jobs.
# Concrete jobs extend these templates and override variables/stages as needed.

# Base Terraform Template (.terraform)
# Provides common configuration for all Terraform jobs:
# - Terraform CLI image and automation settings
# - Variable mapping from GitLab to Terraform conventions
# - Provider caching for faster builds
# - Backend configuration setup

    # instead of attempting to read from the console.

    TF_IN_AUTOMATION: '1'

    # Proxy input variables from our convention to variables recognizable by Terraform. We

  # Every job begins execution in the module's root directory with:
  # 1. An empty http backend configuration to be filled in by the gitlab-terraform helper,
  #    and
  # 2. A copy of the GitLab-injected TERRAFORM_TFVARS file variable. (This variable is a
  #    reference to a path in a temporary directory, so we copy it in order to allow
  #    Terraform to see it automatically.)

# Includes safety rules to prevent unauthorized deployments to production AWS resources.
.apply:

  # Rule evaluation uses "first match wins" logic:

  #    (prevents accidental changes to VPC, ECS clusters, load balancers, etc.)
  # 2. WebCMS module changes (ECS task definitions, service configs) run automatically
  #    on integration/main/live branches as they are lower-risk and frequently updated
  # 3. All other scenarios are denied by default (safety net for misconfigurations)

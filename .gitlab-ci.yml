# Jobs defined in this section are template jobs (the leading dot tells GitLab to
# unconditionally ignore them when assembling a pipeline graph). The templates are named
# after the stage in which they execute, and serve as central locations for the
# boilerplate that each step needs to execute. The pipelines here are not complicated in
# the sense that there are a large _variety_ of steps involved; there is instead a large
# _number_ of steps, and cutting down on repetitious information helps avoid visual noise
# when reading this file.
#
# Each template is guaranteed to include the following items:
# 1. The stage in which the job should execute
# 2. The actual job logic itself (which pipeline to trigger or which script to execute).
#
# While some templates may have additional supporting definitions/conveniences, extensions
# MUST provide the following:
# 1. Which environment ($WEBCMS_ENVIRONMENT) this job applies to.
# 2. Where applicable, the site ($WEBCMS_SITE) and language ($WEBCMS_LANG) this job
#    applies to.
# 3. Any throttling/parallelism limitations (e.g., the resource_group: keyword).
# 4. Branch limitations.
#
# Some of this information could be automatically derived in the template, but this can
# very easily cause confusion, so we instead mandate that jobs that extend a template
# repeat the logic to provide clarity on when a job is executed by GitLab, and how
# parallel it is permitted to be.

  # We use GitLab's rules to limit when we block the application of a Terraform module.
  #
  # There are three rules:
  # 1. We require approval of the infrastructure module on its tracking branches (main and
  #    live).
  # 2. We permit automatic application of the webcms module, since it only updates a
  #    limited subset of ECS resources.
  # 3. Any other attempt to apply a Terraform plan is explicitly denied. This is provided
  #    as a safety net to keep misconfigured trigger jobs from accidentally clobbering
  #    live AWS resources.
  #
  # NB. GitLab uses a "first match wins" order of rule evaluation, which is why the third
  # rule does not have an `if:` condition limiting when it applies.
#   rules:
#     - if: >-
#         $TF_MODULE == "infrastructure" &&
#         ($CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "live")

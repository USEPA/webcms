# WebCMS GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
# Orchestrates complete deployment pipeline for EPA WebCMS Drupal application.
# Handles infrastructure provisioning, Docker builds, security scanning, and deployments.
# See docs/cicd-pipeline.md and docs/gitlab_ci_documentation.md for detailed documentation.

stages:
  # Infrastructure Provisioning (live branch only)
  - infrastructure_preprod_build      # Build Traefik reverse proxy image
  - infrastructure_preprod_init       # Initialize Terraform backend and providers
  - infrastructure_preprod_validate   # Validate Terraform configuration syntax
  - infrastructure_preprod_plan       # Generate Terraform execution plan
  - infrastructure_preprod_apply      # Apply infrastructure changes (manual approval required)

  # Docker Image Builds (all branches)
  - build                             # Build application Docker images (drupal, nginx, drush, metrics)
  - copy                              # Mirror third-party images to ECR (CloudWatch agent)
  - Image Scan                        # Security scan images with Prisma Cloud

  # Production Deployment (live branch → WEBCMS_SITE: dev)
  - deploy:dev:init:en                # Initialize English production deployment

  - deploy:development:plan           # Plan development deployment
  - deploy:development:apply          # Apply development deployment (automatic)

  # Staging Deployment (staging branch → WEBCMS_SITE: stage)
  - deploy:stage:init                 # Initialize staging deployment (English + Spanish)

# Our GitLab runner environment is Docker-based, so we apply this tag to every step.

  # 2. We permit automatic application of the webcms module, since it only updates a

  # 3. Any other attempt to apply a Terraform plan is explicitly denied. This is provided
  #    as a safety net to keep misconfigured trigger jobs from accidentally clobbering
  #    live AWS resources.

# WebCMS GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
# Orchestrates complete deployment pipeline for EPA WebCMS Drupal application.
# Handles infrastructure provisioning, Docker builds, security scanning, and deployments.
# See docs/cicd-pipeline.md and docs/gitlab_ci_documentation.md for detailed documentation.
#
# Pipeline Variables:
# - WEBCMS_SITE_FILTER: Set to 'stage' or 'dev' to filter which site's jobs run in the pipeline
#   Example: WEBCMS_SITE_FILTER=stage will only build and deploy stage site
#   Leave unset to build and deploy both sites

stages:
  # Infrastructure Provisioning (live branch only)
  - infrastructure_preprod_init       # Initialize Terraform backend and providers
  - infrastructure_preprod_validate   # Validate Terraform configuration syntax
  - infrastructure_preprod_plan       # Generate Terraform execution plan
  - infrastructure_preprod_apply      # Apply infrastructure changes (manual approval required)

  # Docker Image Builds (all branches)
  - build                             # Build application Docker images (drupal, nginx, drush)

  # Production Deployment (live branch → WEBCMS_SITE: dev)
  - deploy:dev:init:en                # Initialize English production deployment
  - deploy:dev:validate:en            # Validate English production Terraform config
  - deploy:dev:plan:en                # Plan English production deployment
  - deploy:dev:apply:en               # Apply English production deployment

  - deploy:dev:init:es                # Initialize Spanish production deployment
  - deploy:dev:validate:es            # Validate Spanish production Terraform config
  - deploy:dev:plan:es                # Plan Spanish production deployment
  - deploy:dev:apply:es               # Apply Spanish production deployment

  # Staging Deployment (staging branch → WEBCMS_SITE: stage)
  - deploy:stage:init                 # Initialize staging deployment (English + Spanish)
  - deploy:stage:validate             # Validate staging Terraform config
  - deploy:stage:plan                 # Plan staging deployment
  - deploy:stage:apply                # Apply staging deployment (manual approval)

  # Database Updates (Drush operations via ECS tasks)
  - update:es                         # Run Drush updates for Spanish sites
  - update:en                         # Run Drush updates for English sites

  # Release Management
  - artifacts                         # Create deployment artifacts
  - release                           # Create GitLab releases

  # Security Scanning
  - Image Scan                        # Prisma Cloud image vulnerability scanning
  - test                              # Run SAST, dependency scanning, secret detection

# Global Pipeline Configuration
# Our GitLab runner environment is Docker-based, so we apply this tag to every step.
default:
  tags:
    - docker

  # Global caching strategy (fallback/shared cache across all jobs):
  # More specific caches are defined in templates and override this:
  # - Terraform: Lines 116-123 (cached by module + .terraform.lock.hcl for provider binaries)
  # - Composer:  Lines 335-340 (cached by branch for PHP dependencies in Drupal builds)
  # - npm:       Lines 270-278 (cached by ci/package-lock.json for Drush automation)

    paths:

# Define this variable once here and allow it to cascade down into jobs and child
# pipelines. Creates unique image tags based on branch and commit for reproducible builds.

  #    (prevents accidental changes to VPC, ECS clusters, load balancers, etc.)
  # 2. WebCMS module changes (ECS task definitions, service configs) run automatically
  #    on integration/main/live branches as they are lower-risk and frequently updated
  # 3. All other scenarios are denied by default (safety net for misconfigurations)

# WebCMS GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
# Orchestrates complete deployment pipeline for EPA WebCMS Drupal application.
# Handles infrastructure provisioning, Docker builds, security scanning, and deployments.
# See docs/cicd-pipeline.md and docs/gitlab_ci_documentation.md for detailed documentation.

stages:
  # Infrastructure Provisioning (live branch only)
  - infrastructure_preprod_init       # Initialize Terraform backend and providers
  - infrastructure_preprod_validate   # Validate Terraform configuration syntax
  - infrastructure_preprod_plan       # Generate Terraform execution plan
  - infrastructure_preprod_apply      # Apply infrastructure changes (manual approval required)

  # Docker Image Builds (all branches)
  - build                             # Build application Docker images (drupal, nginx, drush, metrics)
  - copy                              # Mirror third-party images to ECR (CloudWatch agent)

  # Global caching strategy (fallback/shared cache across all jobs):
  # More specific caches are defined in templates and override this:

  # - Composer:  Lines 335-340 (cached by branch for PHP dependencies in Drupal builds)

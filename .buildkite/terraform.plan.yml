# This file is a template pipeline for Terraform plans. The pipeline is parameterized by a
# few environment variables that must be present when it is uploaded:
#
# - WEBCMS_ENVIRONMENT: The environment for this module. See terraform/README.md for a
#   more thorough definition.
#
# - WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG: The image tag being deployed. Note that while not all modules use
#   this value, all pipelines will have the image tag inherited from parent.yml. Thus, we
#   assume that its absence is a symptom of a configuration problem.
#
# - WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE: The path to the Parameter Store-based configuration for this
#   plan run. We inject three files into the module:
#
#   1. The backend configuration (required per discussion in terraform/README.md),
#   2. A provider override to switch to AssumeRole-based authentication, and
#   3. The variables pertaining to this run.
#
#   The override is a convenience: instead of using an AssumeRole plugin in the Buildkite
#   agent and having the Docker plugin propagate that auth into the container, we use
#   Terraform's native support for AssumeRole. This allows the SDK to refresh credentials
#   should they expire, and also prevents leaking authentication tokens to the console
#   since they won't be part of the agent environment.
#
#   We save variables in Parameter Store in tfvars format. Different modules have
#   different requirements, and it is difficult to parameterize an unknown number of
#   TF_VAR_* environment variables. Thus, we use Parameter Store.
#
#   As mentioned in this directory's README, the Parameter Store namespace expects the
#   following convention:
#
#   - The backend configuration can be found at ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}/backend
#   - The provider override can be found at ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}]providers
#   - The variables can be found at ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}/variables
#
#   We don't construct the namespace by convention, as the network and infrastructure
#   modules use a different hierarchy than the webcms module does. Specifically, the
#   webcms is the only module where these inputs are scoped by WEBCMS_SITE and
#   WEBCMS_LANG, so it will be the only module that has those values in its Parameter
#   Store path. If we did this unconditionally, the empty values would result in a path
#   containing "///", which causes the API to return a validation error.
#
# - WEBCMS_TF_MODULE: The module being planned by Terraform. This corresponds to a
#   subdirectory of terraform/.
#
# Additionally, there are two optional parameters that can further scope the module being
# planned:
#
# - WEBCMS_SITE: The name of the site (e.g., dev, prod) targeted by this plan
# - WEBCMS_LANG: The language (en or es) targeted by this plan
#
# In the env block below, we have to mark both of them as optional, but in reality, it is
# likely a mistake if you supply one but not the other. We assume that our Terraform
# validations will catch this issue before a larger plan is executed.
#
# The entire env block is, strictly speaking, superfluous: the agent already has access to
# these environment variables, and we don't use them in scripts where the agent hasn't
# already performed substitution. We do this anyway for a two reasons:
#
# 1. The special syntax ${NAME?} forces the agent to fail immediately if the variable NAME
#    wasn't found in the environment. This allows us to avoid a problem cascade wherein
#    Terraform used the string and created weirdly-named resources or caused
#    hard-to-diagnose errors.
#
# 2. By listing the variables here, it serves as a documentation block of sorts for the
#    inputs this pipeline expects.

env:
  WEBCMS_ENVIRONMENT: ${WEBCMS_ENVIRONMENT?}
  WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG: ${WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG?}

  WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE: ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE?}
  WEBCMS_TF_MODULE: ${WEBCMS_TF_MODULE?}

  WEBCMS_SITE: ${WEBCMS_SITE:-}
  WEBCMS_LANG: ${WEBCMS_LANG:-}

  AWS_REGION: us-east-2

steps:
  # Label this step with the module. Note that for the infrastructure and network modules,
  # the label will end with "( )", but this is as good as we can do with simple string
  # interpolation.
  - label: ":terraform: Plan ${WEBCMS_TF_MODULE} (${WEBCMS_SITE} ${WEBCMS_LANG})"

    # The concurrency group here, while unwieldy, serves a few different purposes:
    #
    # 1. Concurrency group names in Buildkite are global to the Buildkite organization. We
    #    introduce a namespace of sorts by using the pipeline slug as a prefix.
    #
    # 2. We want to be able to execute separate Terraform runs in parallel, but prevent
    #    overlapping Terraform runs. A concrete example: it should be possible to run
    #    Terraform against the English and Spanish sites at the same time, and build
    #    multiple environments at the same time.
    #
    #    A Buildkite concurrency group is the perfect solution for this problem. While we
    #    do make use of DynamoDB for locking, Terraform's behavior is report an error and
    #    exit immediately. (This is often desirable in case a run failed without releasing
    #    the lock.) What we want during a build is to wait for the current plan/apply to
    #    finish before starting ours, which is the exact behavior of a concurrency group.
    #
    # As a final note, we unconditionally interpolate $WEBCMS_SITE and $WEBCMS_LANG
    # despite them not always being set to a non-empty value. This is not an issue for
    # Buildkite, it just means that the network and infrastructure modules' concurrency
    # group names will end with "--". The group name doesn't have to look pretty, it just
    # has to work.

    plugins:
      # This plugin is responsible for copying the Terraform configuration from Parameter
      # Store into files to be read by the Terraform CLI. See the discussion in the
      # comments above for what the parameters are for.
      - ./.buildkite/plugins/aws-parameters:
          role: arn:aws:iam::316981092358:role/BuildkiteParameterReadRole
          params:
            - key: ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}/backend
              file: terraform/${WEBCMS_TF_MODULE}/backend.tf
            - key: ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}/providers
              file: terraform/${WEBCMS_TF_MODULE}/providers_override.tf
            - key: ${WEBCMS_SSM_NAMESPACE}/variables
              file: terraform/${WEBCMS_TF_MODULE}/terraform.tfvars

      # Having loaded the configuration and ensured Terraform runs aren't overlapping each
      # other, we can finally execute the official Terraform Docker image.
      #
      # This plugin performs a short script that changes to the module directory,
      # initializes the backend and providers, and then outputs the Terraform plan to the
      # Buildkite build logs.
      #
      # The environment variables we provide to the Terraform container can be broken down
      # into two categories:
      #
      # 1. Variables that affect Terraform's behavior:
      #
      #   - TF_INPUT: The Buildkite agent emulates a standard terminal when executing
      #     build jobs, and this means that Terraform thinks there is a human operator
      #     present. By setting this explicitly to 0, we override this heuristic and force
      #     it to fail when a required variable is not set.
      #
      #   - TF_IN_AUTOMATION: This asks Terraform to make its output more amenable to logs
      #     and CI/CD runs. There is no specific guarantee by Terraform as to what changes
      #     this makes, but it is consistent with the recommendations for CI/CD
      #     implementations of Terraform, so we leave it set.
      #
      # 2. Default values for module inputs. The Terraform CLI treats this differently
      #    than variables assigned in a .tfvars file or via the -var flag. If a variable
      #    is not declared by the module, then Terraform will not read the corresponding
      #    environment variable. This allows us to set values that may not be used without
      #    the CLI reporting spurious errors.
      #
      #    All modules have variables named "aws_region" and "environment", so we populate
      #    those using their corresponding TF_VAR_* environment variables. In addition, we
      #    copy a few variables only used by the webcms module:
      #
      #    - TF_VAR_site is set to the value of WEBCMS_SITE
      #    - TF_VAR_lang is set to the value of WEBCMS_LANG
      #    - TF_VAR_image_tag is set to the value of WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG

          # sync with terraform.apply.yaml.

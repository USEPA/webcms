 * (that is, the exitCode field is exactly 0).
 *
 * In general, the `stop` and `exit` fields use this format for output:
 * 1. If both the code and reason are available, then this field will be the string
 *    `"<code> (<reason>)"`.
 * 2. If only one of the code or reason are available, then this field will be that value.
 * 3. Otherwise, it will be the string `"Unavailable"`.
 *
 * If the container was killed by a signal, then we output the signal number and, if we
 * can determine it, the signal name. (This can help in tracking down errors caused, for
 * example, by segmentation faults, as it surfaces the underlying SIGSEGV.)

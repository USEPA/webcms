# This file contains the necessary steps to execute Terraform modules. It arranges for the
# GitLab Terraform helper (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-images) to execute
# various steps in the Terraform module development cycle.
#
# Input variables needed by this file:
#
# Jobs that trigger this pipeline should set these variables:
# - WEBCMS_ENVIRONMENT, the environment name (e.g., preproduction or production).
# - WEBCMS_IMAGE_TAG, the unique tag for images associated with this build.
# - WEBCMS_SITE (optional), the site name (e.g., dev or stage).
# - WEBCMS_LANG (optional), the language code (e.g., en or es).
# - TF_MODULE, the name of the Terraform module to execute. This will correspond to a
#   subdirectory of terraform/ in this repository.
# - TF_STATE_NAME, the name of the Terraform state key in GitLab's Terraform storage. The
#   Terraform helper will use this to compute the full `$TF_HTTP_ADDRESS` from the
#   defaults.
#
# The CI/CD project configuration should set these variables:
# - AWS_REGION, the region in which the runner is executing.
# - TERRAFORM_TFVARS, the path to a GitLab-injected file variable. See below for more
#   information.

# For reasons mentioned in the terraform/ directory's README, the WebCMS project does not
# have a single canonical Terraform module _or_ state. For a single installation of the
# WebCMS, there are a minimum of two modules and three states the CI/CD project needs to
# manage:
#
# 1. The state of the infrastructure module.
# 2. The state of the webcms module for the English site.
# 3. The state of the webcms module for the Spanish site.
#
# As a result of this variability, we require that the CI/CD project configuration inject
# the Terraform variables. It isn't feasible to store the TF_VAR_* variables in a CI/CD
# file due to the complexity of conditional inclusion and merging of files.
#
# Jobs that trigger this pipeline are required to define the GitLab environment to which
# this pipeline applies. This allows the project administrator to use scoped variables
# (see [envs]) to define the variables on a narrow basis. For comparison's sake, a similar
# (albeit Buildkite-specific) implementation using AWS Parameter Store can be found in
# .buildkite/terraform.plan.yml, storing the configuration externally instead of within
# the CI/CD project configuration.
#
# [envs]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/index.html#cicd-variables-for-environments-and-deployments
#
# This pipelines assumes that Terraform input variables are provided as a path to a file
# in .tfvars format (see [tfvars]) in GitLab. This This implies that the configuration should
# be stored as a file type variable (see [types]) in Gitlab The variable should be scoped to
# the GitLab environment named by the job that triggered this pipeline. See .gitlab-ci.yml
# for the naming convention in use there.

# We define three stages, which correspond 1:1 to the Terraform commands of the same name.
stages:
  - init

  - plan
  - apply

    # Proxy input variables from our convention to variables recognizable by Terraform. We

  # Every job begins execution in the module's root directory with:
  # 1. An empty http backend configuration to be filled in by the gitlab-terraform helper,
  #    and
  # 2. A copy of the GitLab-injected TERRAFORM_TFVARS file variable. (This variable is a
  #    reference to a path in a temporary directory, so we copy it in order to allow
  #    Terraform to see it automatically.)
  #
  # We do not explicitly invoke `gitlab-terraform init` because the helper script does
  # this automatically as needed.

#region Steps

# Steps here are largely based off of the recommendations in GitLab's documentation and
# templates repository. We use a slightly customized version of the template steps
#
# See:
# - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/
# - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform/Base.latest.gitlab-ci.yml

# Initialize the providers and backend
init:
  extends: .terraform
  stage: init

  script:
    - gitlab-terraform init

# Validate syntax and configuration
validate:
  extends: .terraform
  stage: validate

  script:
    - gitlab-terraform validate

# Perform a plan, uploading the plan files as GitLab artifacts.
plan:
  extends: .terraform
  stage: plan

  script:
    - gitlab-terraform plan
    - gitlab-terraform plan-json

  artifacts:
    name: plan
    paths:
      - $TF_ROOT/plan.cache
    reports:
      terraform: $TF_ROOT/plan.json

# Perform an apply. Note that this is not always automatic; see the comments above the rules
# for more.
apply:
  extends: .terraform
  stage: apply

  # Download the plan files from the previous step.
  dependencies: [plan]

  script:
    - gitlab-terraform apply

  # We use GitLab's rules to limit when we block the application of a Terraform module.
  #
  # There are three rules:
  # 1. We require approval of the infrastructure module on its tracking branches (main and
  #    live).
  # 2. We permit automatic application of the webcms module, since it only updates a
  #    limited subset of ECS resources.
  # 3. Any other attempt to apply a Terraform plan is explicitly denied. This is provided
  #    as a safety net to keep misconfigured trigger jobs from accidentally clobbering
  #    live AWS resources.
  #
  # NB. GitLab uses a "first match wins" order of rule evaluation, which is why the third
  # rule does not have an `if:` condition limiting when it applies.
  rules:
    - if: >-
        $TF_MODULE == "infrastructure" &&
        ($CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "live")
      when: manual

    - if: >-
        $TF_MODULE == "webcms" &&
        ($CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "integration" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main" || $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "live")
      when: on_success

    - when: never
